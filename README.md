# dwm-msteams-fix
Patch to fix Microsoft Teams notifications problems in dwm window manager.

Microsoft Teams uses its own notification system that vanilla dwm do not handle properly.
This patch do not want to encourage the use of Microsoft Teams since it is proprietary software. 
However, in many working environments it is the main teams communication software, so in the case you must use Microsoft Teams, this patch can be handy.
